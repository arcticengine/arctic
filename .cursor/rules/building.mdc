## Building Arctic Engine Projects

All builds are in-source. Navigate into the project's directory and run CMake + Make there. Never create a `build/` subdirectory or use out-of-source builds.

Buildable projects: `wizard/`, `tests/`, `benchmark/`, `filetest/`, `fuzz_tests/`, `antarctica_pyramids/`. Do not try to build `engine/` or `template_project_name/` directly -- they are not standalone targets.

Always chain cmake/make/run in a single shell command using `&&` to avoid multiple permission prompts.

First build (or after CMakeLists.txt changes / added/removed source files):

```
cd wizard && cmake . && make -j 8
```

Incremental rebuild (source edits only):

```
cd wizard && make -j 8
```

On macOS, executables are inside `.app` bundles. To build and run tests:

```
cd tests && make -j 8 && ./tests.app/Contents/MacOS/tests
```
