### Designed to give you control and not take anything away.

Arctic Engine is an open-source free game engine released under the MIT license. Arctic Engine is implemented in C++ and focuses on simplicity.

Many developers have forgotten exactly why it is that we make games. It's joyless, disillusioning and discouraging for them.

In the 80's and 90's it was possible for a programmer to make a game alone and it was Fun.

Arctic Engine returns the power to the C++ programmer and makes game development fun again.

## Ubuntu and Raspbian linux build instruction

Just execute the following commands in terminal line by line to install all the required libraries and tools, clone the repository to ~/arctic, build and run the demo project: 

```bash
sudo apt-get install git cmake clang libasound2-dev libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev libgles2-mesa-dev
cd ~
git clone https://gitlab.com/seaice/arctic.git
cd ~/arctic
cd ./wizard
cmake .
make -j 4
./wizard
```

### Raspberry Pi notes

Arctic Engine has been tested only on Raspberry Pi 3 model B so far.

If you experience low sound quality on built-in audio output, in /boot/config.txt add the following line:
```
audio_pwm_mode=2
```
You might need to update your firmware in order for this to work.

### Visual Studio Express and Cursor notes

To set up the project in Visual Studio Express or Cursor:
1. Open the project:
   - In Visual Studio Express: Open the generated `.sln` file in the `dungeon` directory
   - In Cursor: Open the `dungeon` directory as your workspace

2. Configure include paths with correct path to the arctic engine directory:
   - Create `.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json` with:
   ```json
   {
       "configurations": [
           {
               "name": "Win32",
               "includePath": [
                   "${workspaceFolder}/..",
                   "${workspaceFolder}/../arctic",
                   "${workspaceFolder}/your_project_dir"
               ],
               "defines": [],
               "compilerPath": "C:/Program Files/Microsoft Visual Studio/2022/Community/VC/Tools/MSVC/14.xx.xxxxx/bin/Hostx64/x64/cl.exe",
               "cStandard": "c14",
               "cppStandard": "c++14",
               "intelliSenseMode": "windows-msvc-x64"
           }
       ],
       "version": 4
   }
   ```
   Adjust the `compilerPath` to match your Visual Studio installation and `your_project_dir` to match your project location.
